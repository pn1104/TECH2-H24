    "# Exercise: Daily returns of US stock market indices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we examine how the three major US stock market indices performed this year.\n",
    "Use the data in `indices.csv` from the folder `../data/stockmarket` to solve the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Load the CSV data and restrict the sample to the calendar year 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hint:* You have to first figure out which character is used to separate individual columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hint:* You should use `pd.read_csv(..., parse_dates=['Date'])` to automatically parse strings stored in the `Date` column as dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The data comes in a \"long\" format where each date-ticker combination is stored in \n",
    "    a separate row. For the following analysis, the data needs to be reshaped such that each \n",
    "    ticker symbol is in its own column (\"wide\" format).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use the [`pivot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html)\n",
    "    method to reshape the `DataFrame` into the desired form. Consult the \n",
    "    [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/reshaping.html#pivot-and-pivot-table)\n",
    "    to see a graphical illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your pivoted `DataFrame` should look as follows:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "        Ticker\tDJIA\tNASDAQ\tSP500\n",
    "    Date\t\t\t\n",
    "    2024-01-02\t37715.0\t14765.9\t4742.8\n",
    "    2024-01-03\t37430.2\t14592.2\t4704.8\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  Create a line plot which shows the time series for each of the three ticker symbols in a single graph,\n",
    "    for example using [`DataFrame.plot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html#pandas.DataFrame.plot).\n",
    "4.  The graph you just created is not very satisfactory as the three\n",
    "    indices are recorded on vastly different scales. Express each index\n",
    "    relative to its initial value in 2024 (so that all three start with the value\n",
    "    1.0) and recreate the previous graph with this normalized data.\n",
    "5.  Another way to check whether the three indices are co-moving is to compute and plot their daily returns.\n",
    "    For each index, compute the daily returns, i.e., the relative change vs. the previous closing price in percent (e.g., using \n",
    "    [`pct_change()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html)), \n",
    "    and plot the three time series of daily returns in a single graph.\n",
    "6.  The previous plots suggests that the three indices co-move a lot. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.  In order to quantify the strength of \n",
    "        this co-movement, compute the pairwise correlations of daily returns using \n",
    "        [`corr()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  Create a figure with 3-by-3 subplots where each off-diagonal plot shows the \n",
    "        scatter plot for two of the indices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        *Hint:* You can use the function [`scatter_matrix()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix.html) to accomplish this task. Alternatively, you can create a figure with 3-by-3 subplots using Matplotlib's \n",
    "        [`subplots()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html), iterate over all rows and columns and add a [`scatter()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) plot to each `axes` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  Add the correlation coefficient for each stockmarket index pair \n",
    "        as text to the corresponding subplot in the figure you created\n",
    "        (this can be done using [`text()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.text.html))."
